            <p class="about-shell"> <span class="span-for-grotto">T</span>he Shell Grotto consists of a winding subterranean passageway, <br>
                about 8 feet (2.4 m) high and 70 feet (21 m) in length, terminating
                in a rectangular room,
                referred to as the Altar Chamber and measuring approximately 15 by 20 ft (5 by 6 m).
                
                -The grotto is entirely underground.
                Steps at the upper end lead into a passage about 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) wide,
                roughly hewn out of the chalk, which winds down in serpentine fashion until it reaches an arch,
                the walls and roof of which here onward are covered in with shell mosaic.
            
                - The purpose of the structure is unknown and various hypotheses date 
                its construction to any time in the past 3,000 years.Hypotheses include: 
                it was an 18th or 19th-century rich man’s folly; 
                it was a prehistoric astronomical calendar; it was a meeting place for sea witchcraft; 
                and it is connected with the Knights Templar or Freemasonry.

            - <span class="second-span-bubble">H</span>idden away in the depths of a Provencal pine forest, yet barely six miles
            from Marseille St Charles railway station,
            this hotel offers the best of both worlds. Balance out a day spent in the bustling city by retreating to the solitude 
            and sanctuary of the forest by night. The bubbles are less than a half-hour drive from 
            the hilltop basilica Notre Dame de la Garde and its panoramic views of the city skyline,
            plus the seafood restaurants of the old port. 
            - The hotel's name, Attrap Reves, which translates to 'dream catcher', evokes a mystical,
            spiritual atmosphere, enhanced by the sparkling of the stars in the night sky. 
            Low air pollution in the forest heightens the chances of a clear sky for optimal
            constellation spotting. Plus bubble living is a nature lover's paradise – expect to 
            see blissfully carefree rabbits and hares bounding through the woodland and the occasional
            tame squirrel chomping on pine nuts. Décor is minimalist yet quirky - for instance, 
            chairs in the shape of high-heeled shoes. More info on : <a class="link-bubble" href="http://www.info.com">bubble hotel info.</a>

                        island of Poel, that separates the Bay of Wismar from the larger Bay of Mecklenburg.
                        The city lies in the middle between the two larger port cities of Lübeck 
                        in the west, and Rostock in the east, and the state capital of Schwerin is located 
                        south of the city on Lake Schwerin. Wismar lies in the northeastern 
                        corner of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region, and is the capital of the district 
                        of Northwestern Mecklenburg. The city's natural harbour is protected by a promontory.
                        The uninhabited island of Walfisch, lying between Wismar and the island of Poel
                        , administratively belongs to the borough of Wismar-Wendorf. This beautiful city is 
                        enormious legacy of history and beauty in the same. 
                        - The historical old town, centered on the huge marketplace 
                        (one of the largest in northern Germany at 10,000 m2 or 110,000 sq ft), is characterized by town
                        houses, manufacture and trading structures of the Hanseatic League, beautiful part of the city
                        built in Brick Gothic style
                        during the 13th to 15th centuries, 19th-century Romanesque Revival architecture and Art Nouveau
                        houses. Distinctive buildings and military works, built during the period of Swedish control during
                        the 17th and the 18th centuries provide another layer of cultural influence.

The market square's focal point is the Wasserkunst, an elaborate wrought-iron fountain imported from
Holland in 1602. The northern side of the square is occupied by the Town Hall, built in Neoclassical
style from 1817 to 1819. Another notable building on the square is a Brick Gothic patrician's home
(Bürgerhaus) called Alter Schwede (Old Swede), erected around 1380.

St. George's Church, the third so-named edifice on the site, dates from 1404. It had escaped major
damage during most of World War II, but on 14 April 1945, three weeks before the end of the war
 it was badly damaged by "Blockbuster bombs" dropped by the British Royal Air Force.
  Reconstruction after German reunification, costing some 40 million Euros, was completed in 2010.

The 80-metre-high (260 ft) tower church of St. Mary's Church (Marienkirche) is the only remainder
 of the original Brick Gothic edifice, built during the first half of the 13th century.
It suffered heavy damage in World War II, and was partially razed in 1960 during the East German era.

St. Mary's Church and the church of St. Nicholas (Nikolaikirche) with its very lofty vaulting,
built from 1381 to 1460, serve as prime examples of Lübeck's St. Mary's Churches architectural
influence on the entire region.

The Fürstenhof, a richly decorated specimen of early Italian Renaissance style was once a ducal 
residence and served later as the seat of the municipal authorities. Built from 1552 to 1565, 
it was restored from 1877 to 1879. The Old School, dating from about 1300, has also been restored. 
The town hall, rebuilt in 1829, houses a gallery of paintings.[6] The Fine Arts Municipal 
Gallery Baumhaus is located in the old harbour area. </p>
